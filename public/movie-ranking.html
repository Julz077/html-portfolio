<h1>My Top Anime Recommendation</h1>

<h2>Isekai</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken</h3>
<p>I watch it because it's chill and relaxing. 
    I watch it because all problems are gonna be solved flawlessly. 
    It's very much a relax-and-destress kind of show with lots of nostalgic elements towards 80s and 90s media.</p>
<h3>Overlord</h3>
<p>Everything about the show just clicked with me in ways very few shows have. The worldbuilding and the characters play a large role, and I love that the main characters are a group of villains and the most powerful one is having to pretend to be an evil ruler while also subconsciously becoming exactly that.</p>

<h3>KonoSuba</h3>
<p>Personally, I enjoy it because the main cast act like… actual friends. Do you ever notice many animes have the main friend group so affectionate and “I love you guys so much!!” Not only is that cringe to me, but it is completely unrealistic for many people. Most times, we insult each other, roast one another, etc. It’s not malicious, it just shows that you are comfortable around one another to do that.</p>
